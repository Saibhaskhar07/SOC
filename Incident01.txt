Description : 
On January 22, 2025 at 02:37 AM , SOC detection rule SOC335 flagged execution of svohost.exe from an unusual path
(C:\temp\service_installer), indicating potential exploitation of CVE‑2024‑49138, a Windows CLFS privilege‑escalation 
vulnerability.
Shortly thereafter, a successful Remote Desktop login from IP 185.107.56.141 confirmed attacker access to the host. 
The alert accurately prevented a full system compromise. Immediate containment and patching followed.


Investigation Details : 
a. Detection
Alert triggered by SOC335 – CVE‑2024‑49138 Exploitation Detected, capturing execution of svohost.exe with 
suspicious hash behavior 
Executable path: C:\temp\service_installer\svohost.exe.
Parent process: PowerShell.exe, launched via a download command — typical of a fileless attack

b. Timeline Reconstruction
14:32–14:35 : Multiple failed login attempts from 185.107.56.141, followed by a successful login as Victor 
PowerShell executed payload that disabled script execution policy and downloaded svohost.exe wrapped in 
ServiceInstaller.zip  

c. Hash & Behavior Analysis
File hash: b432dcf4a0f0b601b1d79848467137a5e25cab5a0b7b1224be9d3b6540122db9 identified as malicious by endpoint sensors 
Behavior: payload spawned conhost.exe with abnormal parameters, consistent with exploitation techniques 


d. Confirmation of Compromise
Newly established RDP session from known malicious IP confirmed active compromise.


Tools Used :
1. Let's Defend SIEM and Endpoint Detection
2. PowerShell Logs
3. VirusTotal
4. IOC hashing and reputation lookup
5. MITRE ATT&CK mapping

Actions Taken : 
1. Isolated host Victor from the network immediately.
2. Blocked 185.107.56.141 at firewall and RDP access.
3. Removed malicious executable and any temporary files.


Conclusion : 
To conclude, a C2 server connection and the running of svohost.exe indicates that the system is compromised. 
PowerShell was used to download and run malicious payload, hence the affected machine was immediately contained 
to avoid any further damage.
After getting a detailed examination of the Endpoint Security logs of the Victor system, it appeared that the
malicious process, svohost.exe, was still in operating stage with PID 7640. This shows that the attacker has 
already managed to compromise the system and start the process with the name svohost.exe as a part of persistence,
and it keeps acting under the name of legitimate service. That there is this process implies that the attacker is 
performing additional malicious operations that could be done with escalated privileges.
